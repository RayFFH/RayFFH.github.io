									<h1>Line follower car<br />
									</h1>
									<p>This was a second year project where the aim was to enable a car to follower a black track that consisted of various turns</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This project used infared sensors to detect black and white. The data was sent to the arduino which would then control the motors to stay on the black line. The microcontroller was programmed so the car could turn left and right and the biggest problems were hairpins where the gap between the black and white areas were too small for the sensor to pick up. </p>
								<p>Testing and obtaining results was a constant task during the project. We had to find the best motor speed to use in order to get the fastest lap time. This involved finding the perfect balance between turn speed and turn accuracy.Addtionally we had to keep the voltage consumption low as the max amount of voltage we could get from our batteries as 7.5V. Another challenge was finding the optimal angle and distance that the infared sensor should be at. A delay was present with the detection of the sensors and the motors reacting to that detection. This meant we had to put the sensors at an angle to detect the change much earlier so that the motors could turn in time. If you want to know more about this project I did please email me and I'll answer any questions. </p>
